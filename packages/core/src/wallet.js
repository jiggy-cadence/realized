/**
 * wallet.js — read an address's Uniswap v3 positions from The Graph.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IS SMALLER THAN YOU EXPECT, AND DELIBERATELY SO
 *
 * The obvious version of "connect your wallet" shows a per-position P&L. We measured the
 * Position entity before writing it (WALLET-CONNECT-NOTES.md, live mainnet, 2026-09-11) and
 * two of its fields do not mean what their names say:
 *
 *   collectedFeesToken0/1 — populates ONLY when the LP calls collect(). Measured: of 150
 *     positions with collectedFeesToken0 == 0, SEVENTY-ONE had feeGrowthInside0LastX128 != 0.
 *     They earned fees and never collected. The field is a WITHDRAWAL record wearing an
 *     EARNINGS name. Using it as fee income tells ~47% of uncollected wallets "you earned $0"
 *     while the chain disagrees.
 *
 *   depositedToken0/1, withdrawnToken0/1 — LIFETIME CUMULATIVE, not entry state. Measured:
 *     75% of live positions look "one-sided" (exactly one token zero), which is not exotic LP
 *     behaviour, it is what a running counter looks like after a withdraw/re-deposit cycle.
 *     So deposited* cannot be read as "position value at entry".
 *
 * Shipping a fee number off collectedFees* would reproduce, inside our own product and pointed
 * at the user's own money, the exact defect this project exists to expose: a metric whose label
 * has drifted from the thing it measures. So we don't.
 *
 * WHAT WE DO SHIP, because these fields ARE reliable:
 *   owner, pool, tickLower/tickUpper, liquidity.
 *
 * Those answer the question that actually upgrades the product: WHICH pools is this wallet in,
 * and AT WHAT RANGE. Every number on the site until now assumed a +/-2x band. A connected
 * wallet doesn't have to assume — we read the real ticks and feed the real range into the
 * existing, tested positionRealized path.

 *
 * NOT a tuned number. Measured (scripts/probe-tick-widths3.mjs, n=1000 live mainnet positions):
 *
 *   spanFrac cutoff | positions classified | worst IL error accepted
 *   0.80            | 98                   | 0.00pp

 *
 * The classification is flat across the whole sweep and the IL error is exactly zero, because
 * the underlying distribution has a hole: successive 5% bins from 80% to 95% hold 0, 1, and 0
 * positions. The threshold lives inside that hole, so moving it anywhere sensible changes
 * nothing. That is the repo's gate-cannot-audit-its-estimator rule satisfied: reported at five
 * cutoffs, the winner does not change, therefore a finding rather than a parameter.
 *
 * Why span fraction and not widthX: widthX for these positions reaches 1e26+, which (a) reads
 * as a bug in a UI even when arithmetically correct and (b) is a WORSE classifier -- sweeping
 * widthX cutoffs moved the count 374->370 AND carried non-zero IL error. Span fraction is
 * scale-free and exact.
