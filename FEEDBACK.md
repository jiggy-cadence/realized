# FEEDBACK.md — Uniswap developer feedback from building REALIZED

**Project:** [REALIZED](https://realized.drainfun.xyz) · [jiggy-cadence/realized](https://github.com/jiggy-cadence/realized)
**Event:** ETHOnline 2026
**What we integrated:** Uniswap v3 subgraphs (4 chains, position-state reads) and the Uniswap v4
mainnet subgraph (position reconstruction from `ModifyLiquidity` events).

This is written from things that actually cost us time during the build, with the file and line
that each one produced. Nothing here is a feature wish we didn't hit ourselves.

## 1. The v4 `Position` entity carries no tick range, and that is the whole product

This was the single biggest surprise of the build, and it changed what we could offer per venue.

In **v3**, a position's range is state on the NFT. We query it directly
([`packages/core/src/wallet.js`](packages/core/src/wallet.js), `POSITION_FIELDS`):

```
tickLower { tickIdx }
tickUpper { tickIdx }
depositedToken0 / withdrawnToken0 / collectedFeesToken0 / feeGrowthInside0LastX128 ...
```

So "what range is this LP actually in, and what did they realize?" is one query.

In **v4**, `schema.graphql` defines `Position` as:

```graphql
type Position @entity(immutable: false) {
  id: ID!
  tokenId: BigInt!
  owner: String!
  origin: String!
  createdAtTimestamp: BigInt!
  subscriptions: [Subscribe!]!    @derivedFrom(field: "position")
  unsubscriptions: [Unsubscribe!]! @derivedFrom(field: "position")
  transfers: [Transfer!]!          @derivedFrom(field: "position")
}
```

There is **no `tickLower`, no `tickUpper`, no `pool`, no `liquidity`** — and no `@derivedFrom` link
to `ModifyLiquidity`, even though `Pool` has exactly that (`modifyLiquiditys: [ModifyLiquidity!]!
@derivedFrom(field: "pool")`). The range exists only in the event log.

The data itself is all indexed — `ModifyLiquidity` carries `tickLower`, `tickUpper`, `amount` and
`pool`, and there is a full `Tick` entity. **Nothing is missing from the index; what's missing is the
join from a position to its own liquidity history.** That is what makes this a schema decision with
a cheap fix rather than an indexing limitation.

We had to reconstruct it ([`packages/core/src/v4.js`](packages/core/src/v4.js)): group a wallet's
events by `(pool, tickLower, tickUpper)` and sum the **signed** `amount`, where a net-positive key is
an open position.

**Why this matters beyond our project:** reconstruction is a strictly weaker evidence class than a
state read, and the difference is user-visible. We ship v3 with `realizedReturn: true,
exitSimulation: true` and v4 with **both false** — on purpose — because we will not price an exit off
reconstructed liquidity ([`packages/core/src/venues.js`](packages/core/src/venues.js), `CAPABILITIES`).
An entire class of portfolio/PnL tooling either degrades on v4 or, worse, doesn't notice and reports
confident wrong numbers.

**Concrete ask:** give `Position` a link to its liquidity history — either `tickLower`/`tickUpper`/
`pool`/`liquidity` directly, or a `@derivedFrom` edge to `ModifyLiquidity` of the kind `Pool` already
has. It would collapse ~300 lines of reconstruction and three classes of edge case (below) into one
query, and would let integrators offer the same answers on v4 that they offer on v3.

As written, every team building v4 position tooling reimplements this reconstruction independently,
and each one has to rediscover sections 2–4 below on their own. Most will not — all three failure
modes are silent.

## 2. `sender` is the position manager contract, not the human — and `owner` is commented out

Querying `ModifyLiquidity` by `sender` for a wallet that **definitely has positions** returned
**zero rows**. Not an error — an empty, plausible-looking result. Switching to `origin` (the EOA)
returned that wallet's events.

The reason is visible in `schema.graphql` (lines 233–239):

```graphql
type ModifyLiquidity @entity(immutable: true) {
  ...
  # owner of position where liquidity modified to
  # owner: Bytes            <-- commented out
  # the address that modified the liquidity
  sender: Bytes
  # txn origin
  origin: Bytes!            # the EOA that initiated the txn
}
```

**The field that would answer "whose position is this" exists in the schema and is commented out.**
That single line is why position ownership has to be inferred from `origin`, and why `origin` is an
imperfect proxy: it is the EOA that *initiated the transaction*, which is not always the position's
owner (see section 4).

**Concrete ask:** restoring `owner` on `ModifyLiquidity` would fix sections 2 and 4 at once, and
would make section 1's reconstruction correct rather than merely careful. If it was commented out
because the PoolManager event doesn't carry it directly, that constraint is worth stating in the
schema comment — right now it reads as an unfinished line rather than a decision.

This is the worst shape a mistake can have: it looks like "this user has no positions" rather than
"you used the wrong field." A brand-new integrator can ship that and never know.

Failing that: one sentence in the field description — `sender` = position manager contract,
`origin` = EOA, use `origin` for wallet lookups. GraphQL introspection returns `description: null`
for every field on `Position`, so the `#` comments in `schema.graphql` never reach the people
querying the deployed subgraph. Promoting those comments to schema descriptions would surface them
in every GraphQL client and IDE for free.

(Documented at [`packages/core/src/v4.js`](packages/core/src/v4.js) lines 15–16.)

## 3. ~48% of v4 `ModifyLiquidity` events are `amount: 0`

Fee-collection / no-op modifies come through as events at **real-looking tick ranges** with
`amount: 0`. In our first sample, 4 of the first 5 events were `amount: 0`.

Counting them **invents positions the wallet does not hold**. We skip them and report
`zeroAmountEvents` in the response so the number is auditable rather than hidden — it's also the stat
that explains why an address with thousands of events holds few positions.

**Concrete ask:** either a documented event subtype/flag distinguishing liquidity modification from
fee collection, or a note in the docs that `amount: 0` events must be filtered for position
reconstruction. This is a trap every v4 position integrator will hit independently.

---

## 4. Net-negative liquidity keys are legitimate, and there's no way to tell why

Some `(pool, tickLower, tickUpper)` keys sum **negative**: removes with no matching adds. Measured on
`0x996d…ad77`, 3 of 294 keys, each `adds=0 / removes=1`, all in one pool.

That is not an arithmetic bug — it's a position **transferred in**, or opened via a manager that
recorded a different `origin`. The removal is real; this wallet's history just doesn't contain the
position's whole life.

We can detect the situation but **cannot resolve it** from the subgraph, so we classify these as
`incompleteHistory` and deliberately withhold their size rather than invent liquidity or silently
drop a real on-chain event.

Note that `Transfer` **is** modelled, with a `position` pointer, `from`, and `to`. So the ownership
change is indexed — it just cannot be joined back to the liquidity, because `ModifyLiquidity` has no
`owner` (section 2) and `Position` has no liquidity edge (section 1). The three findings are the same
missing join seen from three directions.

**Concrete ask:** same as section 2 — restoring `owner` on `ModifyLiquidity` would make transferred-in
positions resolvable instead of merely detectable.

---

## 5. What worked well, specifically

- **v3 subgraph schema is excellent for exactly this use case.** `feeGrowthInside*X128` alongside
  `collectedFees*` let us distinguish *accrued* from *collected* fees — that distinction is load-
  bearing for us: of 150 positions reading zero collected fees, **71 had real accrued fees**. Without
  both fields we would have reported `$0` and been wrong 47% of the time.
- **Schema consistency across chains is genuinely good.** The same v3 query shape runs unmodified
  against mainnet, Arbitrum, Polygon and Base — our venue map is just four subgraph IDs
  ([`packages/core/src/venues.js`](packages/core/src/venues.js)), not four code paths. One
  implementation of the math serves all four.
- **`poolDayData` made the core product possible.** Realized return = fees + impermanent loss needs
  per-day historical pool state for both tokens. We verified the alternative: `feeGrowthGlobal0X128`
  is readable at any historical block from an archive node, but the join (block lookup per day
  boundary + historical price for both tokens, per pool, × 376 pools × 4 chains) is thousands of
  archive calls per rebuild. The subgraph publishes that join already computed.
- **`ModifyLiquidity` cursor pagination on `id_gt` has no skip ceiling**, so complete event history
  is retrievable for busy wallets — our busiest sample needed 6 pages (5,205 events) in ~4s.

## 6. One documentation note

The v4 subgraph is a different *evidence model* from v3, not just a different version number, and we
didn't discover that until we had already designed around v3 semantics. A short "migrating position
tooling from v3 to v4" page — Position entity differences, `origin` vs `sender`, `amount: 0` events —
would have saved us most of a build day, and would likely prevent a wave of v4 portfolio tools that
report reconstructed numbers as if they were state reads.
